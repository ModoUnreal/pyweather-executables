## Updater for PyWeather

PyWeather uses a .json file, in which build numbers are compared.

Build numbers are creatively sequenced by removing the dots.

0.3 beta's build number is 30. 0.3.1 beta's BN is 31. 0.4 beta = 40. 1.0 = 100, and so on.

The updater's API version shows the API version of said updater. If the updater API moves on to v2, I'll keep the legacy v1 API as well.

One could also use updater.py to check for updates, but not view the weather.
